# CDL_Quantum_Computing_Projects

## Description

Multiple quantum computing projects I completed as a member of a group of 5 during the CDL quantum computing bootcamp.


The first project "Trapped Ions" involved using a trapped ion quantum computer simulate random numbers (probabilities of a bit flip for example). This project won 1st place as the top weekly cohort project.

The second project "Rydberg Atoms" involved solving the Travelling Sales person optimization problem using a rydberg quantum device. This project placed 2nd in the weekly competition.

The Week 3 project involves simulating quantum chemistry models using VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver).

The Week 4 project involves advanced simulations of QNLP (Quantum Natural Language Processessing)

## How to read?

Click on a repository to view the project. There is a technical README, as well as a Business application which contains ideas on how we intended to use this technology in a business. The README will have links to the jupyter notebooks with the relevant code, or you can select those notebooks separatly. There is an instruction pdf file in each repository where you can view the tasks we were charged with.
