# CDL_Quantum_Computing_Projects
Multiple quantum computing projects I completed as a member of a group of 5 during the CDL quantum computing bootcamp.


The first project "Trapped Ions" involved using a trapped ion quantum computer simulate random numbers (probabilities of a bit flip for example). This project won 1st place as the top weekly cohort project.

The second project "Rydberg Atoms" involved solving the Travelling Sales person optimization problem using a rydberg quantum device. This project placed 2nd in the weekly competition.

Languages used: Julia, Python
